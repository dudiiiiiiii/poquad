# PoQuAD
**PoQuAD** is the Polish Question Answering Dataset. It is modeled on the SQuAD 2.0, including the impossible questions. Additionally it includes a generative answer layer, which allows to train models to return the most natural sounding responses to the queries. The textual data are original Polish texts from Wikipedia, and they were selected to reflect the topics most relevant to Polish speakers.
